# Introduction to the Wireless Modbus Module

## Overview of the Modbus Protocol

Modbus is an application-layer messaging protocol, designed in 1979 by Modicon, which facilitates master/slave interaction between devices. A de facto communication standard in industrial electronics, it has the following features:

* **Master-Slave Architecture**: One master device issues commands to one or more slave devices that respond in kind.
* **Data Representation**: Modbus categorizes data as either coils (binary) or registers (numeric), offering diverse data manipulation capabilities.
* **Variants**: Modbus has adapted to different environments with variants like Modbus RTU, Modbus ASCII, and Modbus TCP/IP.

## The RS485 Communication Standard

RS485, or EIA-485, prescribes electrical specifications for drivers and receivers in digital multipoint systems. It is characterized by:

* **Extended Communication Range**: Capable of transmitting data up to 4000 feet (~1200 meters).
* **Noise Resistance**: Differential signaling provides robustness against voltage fluctuations and electromagnetic interference.
* **Multi-Drop Configurations**: Supports up to 32 devices on a single bus network.

RS485's reliability is a cornerstone of industrial controls in leveraging Modbus protocol.

## Connection

### RS485 Connection

## Features of the Wireless Modbus Module

> Firmware version 0.2

The module supports baud rates [in bps]: `1200` to `1000000`, including automatic master node baud rate detection and synchronization.

### Communication Between Master and Slave

The interaction comprises the master's request, the slave's response, and the corresponding response times as shown:

Example timing for a 69-byte request and  8-byte response Modbus RTU query. Response timing across UART and wireless PHY settings:

|UART Settings	| Net PHY Speed	| Response Time [ms]|
|---|---|---|
4800-8-1-E	| 1M	| 222
9600-8-1-E	| 1M	| 127
14400-8-1-E	| 1M	| 94
19200-8-1-E	| 1M	| 76
115200-8-1-E	| 2M	| 28
500000-8-1-E	| 2M	| 17

### Configurations and User Interface

Configuration channels include ATCMD, UART-based commands, physical interfacing (buttons/switches), and upcoming BLE.

#### LED Indicators

Two LEDs (Blue and Red) denote operational states. Patterns of their light signify network status and the network node mode. It varies as follows - fast flash, slow flash, and constant on. For example:

State           | LED Activity                                | LED Interval 
|---|---|---|
Network Loss    | Fast flash: 100ms on/off                    | 500ms off    
Network Sync    | Continuous: 3sec on                         | 500ms off    
|Network Wait |	Slow flash(500ms on/off)	 |500ms off

#### Dip Switch Configuration

Settings like SW1 and SW2 determine network status and node mode, respectively.

Setting RS485 parity with SW3 and SW4.

Switch | Function               | Description
|---|---|---|
SW1    | Network start/config   | On: Activate; Off: Default. See below.
SW2    | Node mode              | On: Master; Off: Slave.
| SW3 | RS485 parity enable | **On:** Enable parity; **Off:** Disable parity
| SW4 | RS485 parity mode | **On**: ODD Parity; **Off**: EVEN parity

**SW1 Configuration Details**
* **ON to OFF**: Trigger reconfiguration; a fast flash indicates readiness to reconfigure.

### AT Commands

Each command starts with `AT` and ends with a terminator. The command and response bodies vary by read parameter or result code.

#### Normal AT Commands

Command | Response | Description
|---|---|---|
AT+MODE=?, | +MODE=[m,1,0] | Read the device Mode. **m**: 1, master; 0, slave.
AT+STATE=?,| +STATE=[x,p,ch]|Read net state. **x**:1, sync; 0, loss. **p**: phy. **ch**ï¼šchannels 
AT+UART=?|+UART=[baud,data,stop,parity,th]|Read RS485 UART setting. **baud**:baudrate; **data**:data bits(8); **stop**: stop bits(0: 1bit, 1: 2bits), **parity**:(0:disable, 1: odd, 2: even); **th**: internal threshold.
AT+PKTL=?,|+PKTL=[up,dn]|Read data packege size. **up**: uplink size; **dn**: downlink size
AT+PKTL=[up,dn],|Result code|Write data packege size. **up**: uplink size; **dn**: downlink size
AT+LOG=x|Result code|Write Log enable level **x**: bit[0:2]. 3 levels
AT+ADDR=?|+ADDR=[xxyyxxyy]|Read net address. **xxyyxxyy**: address 
AT+ADDR=[xxyyxxyy]|Result code|Write net address. **xxyyxxyy**: address. send`AT+SYSCMD=3`save config and send`AT+SYSCMD=1` to apply
