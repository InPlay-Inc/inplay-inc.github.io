## Overview

The GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) is organized into five ports. And there are two types of GPIOs: mixed-signal GPIOs and digital GPIOs:
- Digital GPIO:
	- Port: Port 0, port 1, port 3 and port 4
	- Can NOT be used as sensor ADC input
- Mixed GPIO:
	- Port: Port 2
	- Can be used as sensor ADC input
