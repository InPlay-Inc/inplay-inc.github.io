## Overview

CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is a widely used error-detecting code in digital communication networks and storage devices. It is a mathematical algorithm that calculates a checksum based on the data being transmitted or stored, which can then be used to detect errors during transmission or storage.

## Features
- Support calculate fix length data or variable length data
- Support DMA(need occupy one I2C DMA channel)
- Support configuare parameters such as polynomial selection, initial value, XOR output and so on.
