An advertising packet is a small amount of data that contains device identifiers and other relevant information. The transmission of advertising packets is connectionless, meaning that it does not require pairing or connection operations before establishing a Bluetooth connection.

It enables different types of Bluetooth devices to communicate and exchange data efficiently, particularly in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices such as smart bracelets, watches, and health monitoring devices.

Within Bluetooth communication, there are typically two connection modes: Central and Peripheral. The Central mode represents the party that takes the initiative in establishing the connection, whereas the Peripheral mode signifies the party that passively accepts the connection.

The scanning process allows the central device to discover and connect to nearby peripherals.

After receiving these data packets, the receiving device can directly read and parse the raw data without any decoding or processing.
