In BLE-enabled systems, the Host Controller Interface (HCI) serves as a crucial bridge between the host (application processor) and the Bluetooth controller embedded in the device. HCI commands play a pivotal role in facilitating communication and control between these two components.
Purpose of BLE HCI Commands # BLE HCI commands are standardized instructions exchanged between the host and the Bluetooth controller to manage and configure Bluetooth communication.</description></item><item><title>picShow</title><link>https://inplay-inc.github.io/docs/in6xxe/getting-started/picshow/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://inplay-inc.github.io/docs/in6xxe/getting-started/picshow/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
