The NanoSync timers can be also used as trigger sources for the NanoSync engine(Trigger Handler). If the current time of a NanoSync timer equals to the programmed target time (called emit time), a trigger (We also call the trigger from SyncTimer as an emit) happens. Each SyncTimer supports up to 10 emit time target.</description></item><item><title>NanoSync Engine Guide</title><link>/docs/in6xxe/user-guides/nanosync-technology/trigger-handler-guide.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/in6xxe/user-guides/nanosync-technology/trigger-handler-guide.html</guid><description>NanoSync Engine Guide # Introduction # NanoSync engine(trigger handler block) which can be used to perform many real-time events or tasks without the CPUâ€™s intervention.
The NanoSync engine operates based on triggers and handlers. When a trigger (also called an event) happens, a handler will be invoked. A handler consists of a sequence of hardware actions (also called hardware tasks), which can be automatically executed by the hardware without the CPU intervention.</description></item></channel></rss>
